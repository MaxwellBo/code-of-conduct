# Code of Conduct

UQCS is dedicated to providing a community for everyone. Community participants violating the following rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the executive committee.

We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* offensive comments related to:
  * gender or anything to do with it (identity, history, expression, non-binary gender, etc.)
  * sexual orientation
  * disability
  * physical appearance
  * body size
  * race
  * religion
  * programming experience or background
* sexual images and languages in public spaces
* deliberate intimidation
* stalking
* harassing photography or recording
* sustained disruption of community activities, spaces, or other events
* unwelcome physical contact
* unwelcome sexual attention

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

All participants in the community and community-associated activities are subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, participants and community organisers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the executive committee may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the executive committee immediately.

All participants in the community and community-associated activities are expected to abide by the University of Queensland [Student Integrity and Misconduct Policy](http://ppl.app.uq.edu.au/content/3.60.04-student-integrity-and-misconduct).

We expect participants to follow these rules at all UQCS-supported venues - including online venues - and social events associated with UQCS. These venues include but are not necessarily limited to:

- All GitHub repositories and comments under the UQCS organisation
- All communications on the UQCS Slack
- The UQCS Facebook group
- The UQCS Facebook page
- All events organized by UQCS

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact a member of the executive committee.
